For example, you may wish to create a memorial fund to preserve the memory of a loved one, for example, in your own name or in the name of your grandparents, parents, spouse, children, grand-children, relative or even a friend. Or you may wish to create a memorial fund to mark an important occasion, for example, birthday, wedding, death of a loved one and anniversaries. Or you may simply wish to create a memorial fund to sponsor a particular cause, for example, education of children, care of orphans, welfare of the girl-child, empowerment of women, care of disabled, care of the sick, infirm and dying, old age, widows, leprosy, health care of cancer, diabetic, kidney and psychiatric patients, etc.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">What is the difference between a memorial fund and a corpus fund?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A memorial fund is to preserve the memory on an individual or occasion.

Inorder to do this it would be necessary to go through the long-winding and tiresome procedure of creating a Trust. In WE CARE we have made it possible for anyone to create a fund without having to go through the entire legal process of forming a legal entity.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">What is the procedure to create a memorial or corpus fund?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Follow the following steps:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Write to us about your intention.

We do not recollect much of our father&#39;s activities, but we have experienced his strict discipline attitude, which helped us to be more docile and obedient to our mother, this helped her in a way. We have much to speak of our mother as she lived a long life and died at the age of 87. The rare thing which needs mention is that she belonged to one parish all her 87 years. She was one who was well known to all the relatives both on her side and her husband&#39;s side, as most of them would come and stay with her as it was the ancestral house, more so because of her warm and pleasing hospitality, irrespective of their status. She always said that this house has no steps, when it came to welcoming her husband&#39;s step brothers/ sister and their family members, So large was her mind and heart. She was loved by her grandchildren, who often recall all the songs, hymns and her proverbs, a few I would like to mention are &#39;No pain No gain&#39; &#39;A stitch in time saves nine&#39;, &#39;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&#39;. She handed over to us her faith and also saw to it that we practiced it, by daily Mass in summer holidays, daily morning and night prayers and the daily rosary. Yes indeed she took it very seriously that a family that prays together stays together and today in their absence the family is still united and we pray we will stay united.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Marian &amp; Kulandai Mary Ambrose Memorial Health Fund</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Eternally grateful to the Lord Almighty for Curing my mother&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From their loving son, Aruldas Ambrose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 276.48px; height: 230.86px;"><img alt="" src="images/image27.png" style="width: 276.48px; height: 230.86px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This fund is set up to remember and be eternally grateful to our Lord Almighty for curing my mother, Kulandaimary, from TB when I (Aruldas Ambrose) was an infant.

She was trained by me to care for senior and sick patients. Before her untimely death on 8th April 2011, she was the resident care-taker for Mrs. Theresa D&rsquo;Souza, Founder of WE CARE and was residing with her at Providence Home, Carmelaram, Bangalore. According to Kamala&rsquo;s last will and testament, which she made on 02nd April 2011, she desired that all her personal belongings be bequeathed to the poor. She entrusted me with the task of executing her last intentions. Hence after settling her hospital bills and funeral expenses, I am handing over the balance money from her belongings to your Trust, WE CARE, with a request to kindly create a Corpus Fund in her name and memory and utilize the same for the benefit of the poor. The proposed name of the fund: Kamala Nataraj Memorial Charitable Fund.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Kamala was married to Late Mr. Nataraj. As she had no children of her own, she took care of her husband&rsquo;s younger brother who was disabled. After his death, she took up work as a care-taker of patients and worked in Baptist Hospital, Bangalore for many years. Later on she provided home-care to sick and aged patients. As she had no one, whom she called her own, she moved from one patient&rsquo;s home to another and lived with them till their death.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Kamala was a very dedicated care-taker and looked after the patients with devotion. She was also a very spiritual person and used to spend her quite time in prayer. Knowing the seriousness of her health condition, when she was asked what should be done to her personal belongings in case she should pass away? Her only response was, &ldquo;give it to the poor&rdquo;. She wanted her clothing and jewelry to be sold and the money to be given to the poor. Lying in the ICU of St John&rsquo;s Hospital, she was offered free treatment for an open heart surgery. But she told the doctors and nurses, &ldquo;I do not want to be operated upon and I am spiritually ready to die.&rdquo; A few days later, while sitting in prayer, she suffered from a severe cardiac arrest and passed away peacefully. May her soul rest in peace and may her memory live in the hearts of those who will receive benefits from her funds.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The family members of Theresa D&rsquo;Souza are grateful to Kamala for the loving way in which she attended to their mother, during the last two years of her life. While staying together in the Home, both Therese and Kamala became close friends. With the passing away of Kamala, Theresa felt her loss and a few months later passed away. May the soul of Kamala rest in peace.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">John And Celine Smith Fund For Senior Citizens</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I learnt the art of sharing from my grandfather&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 272.68px; height: 208.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 272.68px; height: 208.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who can understand the sufferings of the poor leprosy patients better than those who battled with acute poverty conditions during childhood?&rdquo; asks John Smith, as he recalls his life and experiences.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I am now 79 and my wife Celine is 76 years. I was born in 1932 in South Kanara into an Anglo-Indian family of eleven children and had a rough and tough childhood period. My father was not well-off and we had difficulty at home for food and education. Childhood days were hard when hunger was a constant companion. I learnt the art of sharing from my grandfather. He used to bring soft bread neatly tucked in his umbrella but gave it away to other hungry children on the way! This art of sharing continued to be a trait in my family. After completing my basic education, I got a job in Southern Railways. I got married to Celine, who was trained in nursing and midwifery. She too had a good job in the Railway hospital.</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">God filled my heart with kindness for the poor and spirit of service to the sick. During my visits to Udupi, I used to visit St Anthony&rsquo;s Hospital, Jeppu and donate whatever I could for the care of the leprosy patients. Leprosy was my chosen field as I had seen poor leprosy patients suffering due to isolation and social boycott.</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Celine and John Smith are a pious couple with compassion for all suffering humanity. Despite health problems associated with old age, they are a cheerful couple with a large heart. Even now, they keep apart a tidy sum from their meager income for the poor and suffering.

In her honor and in gratitude for her love and affection for us, we have set up a fund in her memory.</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">We thank her brothers Simon and Peter and other members of her family.

When dad passed away on 12 May, 2007, he looked younger than his 73 years. I suppose that&#39;s one reason why it was easy to forget that here was an aging man. He looked young and we thought he was young. Till suddenly one day, we were forced to deal with his mortality and with the passing away of a husband, a father and a grandfather.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But dad, or Lazarus as the world knew him, was acutely aware of what old age meant. His sympathies were with those who had to spend their last days in old age homes. And he had only praise and admiration for the work of care-givers at such homes, especially the Little Sisters of the Poor.</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why we decided to institute a fund for the aged in We Care in memory of A Lazarus.

He spent his life in cities as varied as Belgaum, Karachi, Baroda, Bombay, Goa, Calcutta and finally, Bangalore. He married in 1958 and was father to four daughters. For his hard work, his sense of responsibility, his devotion to the Church, selflessness and generosity, we couldn&#39;t have asked for a better father.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Our dad is no longer with us.

She could not walk for almost 15 years and had to be carried everywhere. Her brain however was not affected and her intelligence had no boundaries. Despite her frail physical state she studied up till M.A. and appeared for all exams and came out with flying colors.

Her heart and left lung had started malfunctioning. Lying on her bed, she bore her suffering cheerfully and prepared herself for going to meet her God. The candle blew out in a second.

May her soul rest in peace.</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She lived to serve! The gentle tufts of Death&rsquo;s rough call do not move us from the compelling thoughts and images her sterling name evokes. She was a mother who did her best to fulfill the wishes of her ever growing family and she kept a track of everyone of her children. Yes she was the &lsquo;Rita Ma&rsquo; her eldest grandchild Mark D&rsquo;Souza had kept for her.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Mummy, as I knew her, was definite but never distant, loveable but never lily-livered. She loved to go the full mile in helping the defeated and the downtrodden. She was fluent most of all in the simple midst of simple folk. She was a mother most of all to the world at large. She also lived for herself.

Life had lots more to give than it offered in the end. After all, what did she claim from Life? Just see the tragic end she met. Rita Nazareth sprang to safe conclusions but she could not safely guard her own life. So jolly what?</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She was an ideal Mother-loving, loveable and loved. She rose to do all that she could to save those who were defeated and downtrodden. Her Grand notions went well with her basic theme of &ndash; &ldquo;keep it nice and simple&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Mummy lived for others.

I knew that my days on this earth were limited and the clock had begun ticking. But the thought of leaving my loved ones behind, especially my husband and two daughters, was unbearable. They needed me most at this time of their life. &lsquo;I have to live,&rsquo; I told myself and began to fight this disease.

Kevin and Maureen Colaco celebrated their silver wedding anniversary on 31, December 2000, with a difference. They fed over 100 orphan children and donated from their family sources Rs.55,000 to We Care under the fund heading Kevin &amp; Maureen Colaco charity Fund. We have reproduced their letter to We Care below: </span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Our silver year of memories: As our Silver Wedding Day draws near, we recall many happy memories we have gathered on life&#39;s way which add a wealth of meaning to our Silver Wedding day. &quot;A Promise we made before GOD and man, the beating of two hearts in love, prayed that our life together be a happy one blessed by god from above.&quot; We are sweethearts and the closest friends and with each other, our days begin and end. Time has stolen our strength and youth but it has not changed this shining truth. We can&#39;t believe our love has lasted all these years, while hardships came with sorrow&#39;s tears. Met each test and got by, promising each time we will love each other till we die. We are not rich in worldly wealth nor do we own anything gained by stealth, but to each other we remain the greatest treasure, which is our source of pride and quiet pleasure. 31st December dawned and we wished each other all the happiness with which two loving hearts are blessed. Renewed our promises, exchanged Silver Bands and what joy filled my whole being to hear Kevin say &quot; Maureen you were, and are, my choice for life. My girl, my lady, my sweet wife.&quot; What anniversary celebrations are you having? our loved ones asked when we all met to celebrate my sister&#39;s silver wedding only a month before. But we didn&#39;t think much of the celebrations as our eldest son was away in the US on an assignment. We decided that in memory of our Silver Wedding, we would present a silver gift to society to help underprivileged children and that is how the &#39;Kevin &amp; Maureen Colaco Charity Fund&#39; under We Care was born. What immense joy filled us on our Silver Wedding day which was otherwise a quiet affair. We were blessed with two boys who have grown up to be handsome lads. Keith is now working and his gift to us was his contribution to our charity fund. We appreciate his thoughtfulness and gesture and we hope he will continue to help us build up this fund. Conrad is still a student, so we got warm wishes and kisses from him and we hope that his contributions to this fund will flow shortly. Both of us have retired under VRS and plan to help social organizations with our services. I end by saying, loving God and serving Him in such a faithful way will be a source of pride and joy to us. We pray that he may richly bless our future and may it be even happier than the years we&#39;ve left behind.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We Care Leprosy Fund</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Estd 2000.
