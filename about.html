									<h1>About We Care</h1>
								</header>
								
								

								

								<p>Every mighty river begins from a small spring. The idea of We Care too has grown from small human experiences and  humble dreams. From small and scattered acts of charity towards creating a lasting institution that will give expression to the love people have for the poor, underprivileged, deprived and forgotten.</p>
								<p>This dream began two years ago. But it was on 30th January 1999, on the 75th birthday of our Foundress, Mrs Theresa D'Souza, that this dream became a reality. We Care was born our of a true love and concern for the poor.

								<p><h4>Documenting the first well-springs of We Care in the Trust Deed, our foundress writes,</h4></p>
								<blockquote>On the occasion of the celebration of the seventy-fifth year of the gift of life. I have recollected and reminiscences with gratitude and     thanksgiving, the innumerable blessings God Almighty has showered upon me and my family members.
									Midst these recollections and reminiscences and thanksgiving to God, I have not failed to observe the woes of the vast multitude of     the very poor and impoverished people and specially the thousands of children who constantly live a life of deprivation.... deprivation     from basic needs of food,education, medical care and shelter.     And in response and in gratitude to God's generosity to me and to my family and in a gesture of good will to the poor and needy     children I in my own small and humble way am desirous of creating and establishing a charitable trust under the name and style of     We Care which is symbolic of the wishes and desires of myself and that of my late husband John Paul D'Souza to express our care      and love for the poor which we hope will be effective through this trust We Care. </blockquote>
